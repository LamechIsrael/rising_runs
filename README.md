# rising_runs

This code counts the occurrences of characters in a string.
If the second set is greater than the first, then it is a "Rising Run."

For example:

"abbcccrrr" is a rising run.
"nnhhhhttttt" is also a rising run. It does not depend on where the letter in the alphabet. Only how many of them there are.
"aaanppttt" is not a rising run, because there are 3 'a' characters and 1 'n' right after.
